I see my computer wake up sometimes when I’m not using it.
After some searching its the devices in /proc/acpi/wakeup that are allowed to do this.
By echoing the “4-character device name” to /proc/acpi/wakeup you can enable/disable these.
(eg: $ echo USB1 | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup to enable/disable USB1)

I would like an extra panel under Power Management, called “Wake-Up Events”
or something, so i can check and uncheck these.

Currently i have solved this issue with a systemd script, but it could be so much easier just in a nice tab :smile:

Thanks a lot

For those interested, these are my devices, i enabled only the power button. So no mouse click, keyboard touch or wlan/lan packet can wake it up. (see systemd script below, change accordingly for your own benefit)
